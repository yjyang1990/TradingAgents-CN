# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for analyzing and cleaning up unused files in the TradingAgents-CN project. The goal is to identify files that are not referenced or used anywhere in the codebase and safely remove them to improve maintainability, reduce repository size, and eliminate technical debt.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This cleanup aligns with maintaining a clean, efficient codebase that supports the trading agents framework by:
- Reducing complexity and improving code navigation
- Eliminating orphaned files that may confuse developers
- Optimizing build and deployment processes
- Maintaining high code quality standards

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify all unused files in the project, so that I can maintain a clean and efficient codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning the project THEN the system SHALL analyze all file types (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Markdown, configuration files, etc.)
2. IF a file is not imported, required, or referenced by any other file THEN the system SHALL mark it as potentially unused
3. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN the system SHALL check package.json, requirements.txt, and other configuration files for references
4. WHEN checking file usage THEN the system SHALL examine import statements, require calls, and dynamic imports across all code files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to safely remove unused files without breaking the application, so that I can clean up the codebase without introducing bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying unused files THEN the system SHALL exclude critical files like package.json, README.md, LICENSE, and configuration files
2. IF a file is marked for deletion THEN the system SHALL verify it's not referenced in documentation or configuration
3. WHEN removing files THEN the system SHALL delete them immediately without creating backups (as requested)
4. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of removed files and their original purposes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand what each file was intended for before deletion, so that I can verify the cleanup decisions are correct.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing each file THEN the system SHALL determine its apparent purpose based on content, naming, and structure
2. IF a file's purpose is unclear THEN the system SHALL flag it for manual review
3. WHEN presenting cleanup recommendations THEN the system SHALL include the file's identified purpose and reason for removal

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: The analysis must cover all file types and consider all possible reference patterns
- **Safe Deletion**: The cleanup process must avoid removing files that are actually needed
- **Documentation**: Each step must be clearly documented with reasoning

### Performance
- Analysis should complete efficiently even for large codebases
- File operations should be batched for optimal performance

### Security
- No sensitive files (credentials, keys, secrets) should be analyzed or exposed
- File paths and content should be handled securely

### Reliability
- The analysis must be thorough and accurate to prevent accidental deletion of needed files
- Error handling must be robust to prevent partial cleanup states

### Usability
- Progress should be clearly communicated throughout the process
- Results should be presented in an understandable format with clear reasoning
