## Summary and Recommendations

### Overall Assessment
The `/docs` directory represents a comprehensive, well-structured documentation system that is:
- **Heavily referenced** from the main README.md (50+ direct links)
- **Actively maintained** with version-specific updates
- **Core differentiator** of the project (described as 50,000+ words of Chinese documentation)
- **Essential for users** with guides, tutorials, and troubleshooting

### Deletion Recommendations Summary

#### Files to **KEEP** (Majority - ~85%)
- All main documentation directories and their core content
- All files referenced from README.md or other documentation
- All user guides, installation guides, and troubleshooting docs
- All architecture and technical documentation
- All integration and API documentation
- Release notes and changelog (essential for version tracking)

#### Files to **REVIEW** (Minority - ~15%)
- Version-specific fix summaries that may be outdated
- Completed migration documentation that may be archived
- Some improvement and fix reports in `/docs/fixes/` and `/docs/improvements/`
- Development documentation in `/docs/development/` and `/docs/maintenance/`

#### Files to **DELETE** (Very Few - <5%)
- No files identified for immediate deletion
- Some very old fix reports after manual verification
- Potential duplicate documentation after content review

### Key Findings
1. **High Documentation Value**: This is a core feature of the project, not bloat
2. **Active Reference System**: Extensive cross-linking between documentation
3. **User-Centric**: Documentation serves as primary user onboarding and support
4. **Version Management**: Good tracking of changes and updates
5. **Minimal Cleanup Needed**: Most content appears current and valuable

### Recommended Actions
1. **Preserve the majority** of documentation as it's actively used
2. **Review specific files** marked as REVIEW for potential archival
3. **Verify image references** in `/docs/images/` directory
4. **Consider archiving** rather than deleting historical fix reports
5. **Maintain** the current documentation structure as it supports the project's goals
