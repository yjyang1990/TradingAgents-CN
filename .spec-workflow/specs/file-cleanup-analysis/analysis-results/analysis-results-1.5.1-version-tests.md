## üìã Analysis Overview
- **Task**: Analyze version-specific test directories
- **Role**: QA Test Version Manager
- **Directory Analyzed**: `/tests/0.1.14/`
- **Current Project Version**: cn-0.1.15 (from VERSION file)

## üîç Analysis Results

### `/tests/0.1.14/` Directory Analysis

**Version Relevance Assessment**: The 0.1.14 directory contains tests for a previous version (0.1.14) while the current version is cn-0.1.15, making this an outdated version-specific directory.

#### File-by-File Analysis:

1. **`cleanup_test_data.py`** - **DELETE**
   - 63 lines
   - Purpose: Utility to clean up test data and MongoDB test records
   - Reasoning: Version-specific cleanup utility for 0.1.14, no longer needed for current version
   - Evidence: Hardcoded TEST123/TEST001 cleanup for old test scenarios

2. **`create_sample_reports.py`** - **DELETE**
   - 185 lines
   - Purpose: Creates sample analysis reports for testing

6. **`test_data_structure.py`** - **DELETE**
   - 53 lines
   - Purpose: Tests data structure for version 0.1.14
   - Reasoning: Version-specific data structure validation, likely outdated
   - Evidence: Specific to 0.1.14 data format requirements

7. **`test_fallback_mechanism.py`** - **DELETE**
   - 0 lines (empty file)
   - Purpose: Placeholder for fallback mechanism tests

   - Evidence: Contains 0.1.14 specific bug fixes

9. **`test_guide_auto_hide.py`** - **DELETE**
   - 209 lines
   - Purpose: Tests guide auto-hide functionality
   - Reasoning: Version-specific UI test for 0.1.14, may not apply to current version
   - Evidence: Tests specific to 0.1.14 UI behavior

10. **`test_import_fix.py`** - **DELETE**
    - 0 lines (empty file)
    - Purpose: Placeholder for import fix tests
    - Reasoning: Empty file with no functionality
    - Evidence: File size is 0 bytes

11. **`test_online_tools_config.py`** - **DELETE**
    - 172 lines
    - Purpose: Tests online tools configuration for 0.1.14
    - Reasoning: Version-specific configuration tests, likely outdated
    - Evidence: Tests configuration specific to 0.1.14

12. **`test_real_scenario_fix.py`** - **DELETE**
    - 234 lines
    - Purpose: Tests real scenario fixes for 0.1.14
    - Reasoning: Version-specific bug fix tests, issues likely resolved
    - Evidence: Contains specific fixes for 0.1.14 scenarios

13. **`test_tool_selection_logic.py`** - **DELETE**
    - 271 lines
    - Purpose: Tests tool selection logic for 0.1.14
    - Reasoning: Version-specific logic tests, may have evolved in current version
    - Evidence: Tests tool selection specific to 0.1.14

14. **`test_tushare_direct.py`** - **DELETE**
    - 0 lines (empty file)
    - Purpose: Placeholder for Tushare direct tests
    - Reasoning: Empty file with no functionality
    - Evidence: File size is 0 bytes

15. **`test_us_stock_independence.py`** - **DELETE**
    - 96 lines
    - Purpose: Tests US stock independence feature for 0.1.14
    - Reasoning: Version-specific feature test, functionality may have changed
    - Evidence: Tests feature specific to 0.1.14

## üìä Summary

### Directory Analysis:
- **Total Files**: 15
- **DELETE**: 15 files
- **KEEP**: 0 files
- **REVIEW**: 0 files
- **UNKNOWN**: 0 files

### Key Findings:
1. **Outdated Version**: All files are specific to version 0.1.14 while current version is cn-0.1.15
2. **Empty Files**: 5 files are completely empty (0 bytes)
3. **Version-Specific Tests**: All non-empty files contain tests specific to 0.1.14 features/fixes
4. **No Current Relevance**: None of these tests appear to be maintained for the current version

### Recommendation:
**The entire `/tests/0.1.14/` directory should be DELETED** as it contains outdated version-specific tests that are no longer relevant to the current version (cn-0.1.15). The tests were likely created to validate specific fixes and features in version 0.1.14 and are superseded by current testing approaches.
